If you are unsure of what the outcome is supposed to be, you can always launch the solution to see what I did in the browser. This isn't cheating... unless you steal all of my wonderful design ideas!!! ðŸ˜œ

## Exercise 1.0 - Warm up

Write an app that registers a click anywhere on the screen. Once the user clicks, let them know that they did it!

## Exercise 1.1 - Warmer

_no copy/pasting_

Write an app that gives the user 1s (or 1000ms) to click anywhere on the screen. If they click inside of the required time, you should tell them that they've won, else let them know that they've lost.

## Exercise 1.2 - Counting down!

_no copy/pasting_

Similar to the last exercise, write an app that gives the user a random amount of time (up to 5 seconds) to click anywhere on the screen.

But this time, let's let the user know how much time they have to actually 'click'. If they click inside of the required time, you should tell them that they've won, else let them know that they've lost.

## Exercise 2 - The Final Countdown... Clock... and Timer.

_Remember that optional exercise from yesterday..._

**Note:** If you skipped the challenge question yesterday, take a quick look at it, but you don't have to complete it to do this one. I fully expect everyone to start from scratch!

Create a page that

1. contains 3 sections (one for each of the following)
2. displays the current time
2. contains a start/stop button with a stopwatch which starts at 00:00 and continues until the user clicks "stop"
3. contains a timer where the user can enter a number of seconds, click start and the timer counts down to 0. There should be a sound announcingthe end as well.

## Exercise 3.1 to 3.3 - All about Buttons!

Create more buttons than anyone could possibly ever handle...

## Exercise 4 - Is This All a Game to You?!

Create a game that makes the suer click and click and click.

## Exercise 5 - The Big Bad Showdown

This is most likely a full day exercise.

1. Reproduce the game as described in the exercise folder
2. If you havve time and inclination, change the theme of the game to something you prefer.

## Exercise 6 (Challenge) - Create your own game!
