// Exercise 1.2
// ------------
// DON'T COPY/PASTE THE LAST EXERCISE. REWRITE IT FROM SCRATCH!
// Similar to the last exercise, write an app that gives the user
// a random amount of time (between 3 and 5 seconds) to click anywhere on the
// screen.
//
// But this time, let's let the user know how much time they have to actually
// 'click'. If they click inside of the required time, you should tell them
// that they've won, else let them know that they've lost.

// In short,
// Replicate (and I mean, REWRITE it from scratch) the last exercise, and add
// - random amount of time to click (between 3 and 5 seconds)
// - tell the user how much time they have to click.

// HINTS:
// - You can use Math.random to generate a random number betwen 0 and 1, and
//   use math operators to scale it between 3 and 5 seconds

// Stretch goal
// Make the countdown live (show a countdown that updates several times a
// second)
let result = document.getElementById("result");
let time = document.getElementById("time");
let timeOut = 3000 + Math.random() * 2000;

time.innerText = timeOut;

document.body.addEventListener("click", function () {
  result.innerText = "You won!";
  clearTimeout(timeOutId);
});

let timeOutId = setTimeout(function () {
  result.innerText = "Try again!";
}, timeOut);
// Math.random is a value  between 0 and 1. I chhose top value by choosing multiplier.
// If I wanted 0 to 25 * 25)
